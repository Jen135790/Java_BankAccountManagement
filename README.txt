[Background]
	A college Java final project done for my Adv. Java class.

[Description]
	* User-friendly interface that is very easy to navigate through
	* "Existing" users can login using their user name and password
		- If users forget their password, they can reset it by providing their 
			user name and email.
	* "New" users can register for an account.
		- An error will appear if a user name is already in use.
	* Once logged in, they can perform various actions on the "Account Details" 
	  tab and the "Actions" menu option, or view their transaction history in the 
	  "Transactions" tab.
		- Account Details allow users to change email and password
		- Actions allow users to make deposits and withdrawals
		- Transactions shows a history of transactions made by the users.
	* When users are finished, they may log off or exit the application.
	
[Install]
	To see how the program works, you must download the contents in the release 
	folder. Make sure both the jar file and the .mdf database file are in the same 
	folder for the application to work correctly.
